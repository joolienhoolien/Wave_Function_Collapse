[contradiction]
#FAIL_CONDITIONS are to direct the program what to do in case the wave collapses such that a contradiction is created.
# A contradiction occurs when there is a cell with no possible tiles, and would only result in an improper image.
# Options for FAIL_CONDITION:
#    - "END" - end the program and print to command line.
#    - NOT IMPLEMENTED "RESET" - reset the board and try again at a random cell.
#    - NOT IMPLEMENTED "RESET_FROM_FAIL" - reset the board to default and rerun, starting from the failed cell.
#    - NOT IMPLEMENTED "BACKTRACK" - move backwards from the failure point and try new combinations
